1. Static IPv6 Configuration
----------------------------
You need to update and configure The following files for IPv6 configuration:
/etc/sysconfig/network : Turn on networking in this file.
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 : Set default IPv6 router IP and server
IP address in this file.
��Open Terminal:
Change to Root access
Step1: Type su Hit Enter key!
Step2: Enter your Password
��You need to edit the following file
Step3: vim /etc/sysconfig/network
Append the following line:
NETWORKING_IPV6=yes
��You need to change to directory with network-scripts
Step4:
��cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
��vim ifcfg-eth0
Append following config directives for IPv6:
IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6_AUTOCONF=no
MTU=1500

IPV6ADDR=2002::10/64
IPV6_DEFAULTGW=2002::1
:wq Saving file
Restart networking
�� /etc/init.d/network restart
Verify your configuration by pinging ipv6
��ping6 2002::10

N.B: If you wish to add alias Ipv6 or secondary one after
IPV6ADDR(Primary ipv6) add
IPV6ADDR_SECONDARIES=<IPv6-IP-Address>

DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
--------------------------
A. SERVER
==========
The DHCPv6 server configuration file is installed together with the
dhcp package and it can be found at /etc/dhcp/dhcpd6.conf
A simple DHCPv6 server configuration file can look like this:
subnet6 2002::/64 {

range6 2002::129 2002::254;
option dhcp6.domain-search "gishushu.rw";

}
==> To start the DHCPv6 service, enter the command as root.
�� service dhcpd6 start

==> To stop the DHCPv6 server, use the command.
�� service dhcpdv6 stop
==> We are going to advertise our DHCP6 service using radvd
��yum install radvd -y
��vim /etc/radvd.conf
:se nu
un comment from line 6-18 removing # in front of each line
on line 11 change prefix 2002::/64
:wq (Write"Save" and Quit)
��sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
Restart the radvd service:
�� service radvd restart

B. CLIENT
===========
The default configuration of the DHCPv6 client works fine in the most cases. However,
to configure a DHCP client manually:
�� On the panel on top of you screen, right click the network icon.
�� click "Edit Connections..."
�� Double Click on any Interface with to have dhcpv6 ip
�� Go to the "IPv6 Settings" tab.
�� Method, choose "Automatic."
�� Untick Require IPv6 addressing for this connection to complete
�� Then Hit apply and then close.
